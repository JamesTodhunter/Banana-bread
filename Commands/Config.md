# git conig
When first setting up git, you'll need to work with the git config commands in order to set up your identity.
For example, your identity can be set up with commands such as:
```
get config -- golbal user.name "James Todhunter"
git config -- global user.email jmtodhunter10@gmail.com
```
For more information, view the [first tim git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
